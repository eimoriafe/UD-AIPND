# UD-AIPND
My completed projects

The files here shows the code I employed in solutions as part of course-work in the Udacity Nanodegree program.


Project 1 (DSAND): Investigating texts and calls
In this project, I completed five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. I used Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset.Finally, I performed run time analysis of my solution to determine its efficiency.
